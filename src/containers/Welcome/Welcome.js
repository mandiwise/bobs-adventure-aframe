          <p>This is Bob the Robot. He has problem, but you can help him solve it.</p>
          <p>Bob's best dog pal Megabyte has run off. Megabyte does that sometimes when he finds a juicy bone and wants to hide it away somewhere for later. When this happens Bob usually has a hard time finding Megabyte because he doesn't have a program in his robot brain to help with this.</p>
          <img src={images.megabyte} className="mb-2d-rendering" alt="Megabyte of Megabyte, Bob's dog friend" />
          <p>Luckily, Bob's brain runs on JavaScript. You can help Bob find Megabyte by learning a bit of JavaScript and then creating a program to help him look for and find Megabyte.</p>
          <p>You'll have to learn about variables, data structures, function, conditional statements, and loops to help Bob. By solving the challenges in each of the levels, you'll create a new program step-by-step using JavaScript that Bob can use to find Megabyte now, or any other time his dog pal runs off again in the future!</p>
