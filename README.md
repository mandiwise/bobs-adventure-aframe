# Bob's Amazing Programming Adventure

A little experiment to test the plausibility of learning programming fundamentals in the context of a VR game, with help from the following:

- [aframe](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe)
- [aframe-extras](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras)
- [aframe-react](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-react)
- [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
- [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)

Voxel models were created using [Qubicle](http://www.minddesk.com/).
